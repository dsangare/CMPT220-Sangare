Daouda,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

- Good organization of your repository! :)


However,

- You must submit your -complete- assignments on time. (adding me as a
  collaborator is part of it)



Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
